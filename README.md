## Rich-Text-Editor
This project is not actually a RTE, but a bunch of RTE Frameworks tests, like Draft.js and SlateJS.

### THIS IS NOT A COMPONENT TO USE ON ANOTHER PROJECT, (NOT YET)

***

## Demo
A live demo is available [here](alberoneramos.github.io/rich-text-editor)

***

## Motivation
Even though there are a lot of React WYSIWYG editors, most of those just didn't fit the requirements. So I decided to create two editors from scratch: **SlateEditor** (using SlateJS) and **TextEditor** (using DraftJS)

***

## Status
For now, I'm focusing on the **SlateEditor**, but why? Well, Slate has a native support for plugins, and it's much more simple to use than DraftJS, in my opinion. For now, I'll continue on its development.
